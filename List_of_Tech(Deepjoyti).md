#List of Technologies
###Proposed list of technologies to be used

1.  **ASP.NET** for webpage and backend development
    - By using ASP.NET we won't have to worry about page formation and live data binding
2.  **CSS3**, **HTML5**, **jQuery**(with custom theme) to create frontend
3.  For database, we can use **SQL Server**(because it is efficient with transactions) or **MySql**(best free open-source DB for web)
    *Tell me a choice*
4.  For some automation and algorithmic implementation we might require **Python**


*Tell me your suggestions*
