1.  We will make it for Web, Android, iOS

    E.g. - If he selects Sikkim, suggestions will be shown as North Sikkim, Pelling
        â–¬ Weighted graph is suggested to make the map with weight = distance of the place
5. **Let me describe what is the exact idea/plan how it will work.....  
    Suppose Mr. x is a user he chooses to visit Hill station,he has 6 days,he opts for delhi as his place of starting the journey,mode of     transport will be plane.Now our service will be to provide him the best traveling ideas with in 6 days ex delhi,now a perticular place     like shimla is near delhi and it acn be visited within that time,with that he can also visit Mcleod-ganj or kullu and manali.so we         should be able to give him that amount of flexibility to choose between Mcleod-ganj and manali(with kullu).So for that we should give     option to him after he select shimla.that with it what he wants to see exacly and where he can stay what he can eat and in each place     what he can watch
6.  It will be better if we can provide 360' video of that places to him(If its possible or optional for now).He can see map attached to       it as a idea of distance,trafic and weather app of google to see weather of that place,plane/train fare(We want to use free features       of google and any company to provide every facility) 
7.  we can use google map route to give him dynamic route plan.not any perticular place to place plan.
8.  now after all of this..we also can give him a comparative budget idea of that kind of tour offered by travel companys.It will help him     to select perticular company after comparing budget and we will also provide budget if user goes there without help of any traveling       company.
9.  will provide day wise itenary but with a personal touch.which mode of transport should be choosen for that place,at what time of day       he should go there.about that place with exiting photos,whether it is an UNESCO heritage site or not,what place should he drop to see     things.
10. WE ALL HAVE LIMITED IDEA.HAVE TO COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT PLACES,THINGS,FOODS,CULTURE,IF THERE ANY NEED OF GOVT CLEARENCE TO VISIT       THERE(i.e. nessecery for forest),FROM WHERE IT CAN BE OBTAINED....All we should research.
11. User have to log in and we only need their mail-id,name,sex,age,city they live for future use.we will use that data along with search     places by the user to have a idea about user.and will use it to give him a personalise feel later.
