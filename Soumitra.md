5. **Let me describe what is the exact idea/plan how it will work.....  
    Suppose Mr. x is a user he chooses to visit Hill station,he has 6 days,he opts for delhi as his place of starting the journey,mode of     transport will be plane.Now our service will be to provide him the best traveling ideas with in 6 days ex delhi,now a perticular place like shimla is near delhi and it acn be visited within that time,with that he can also visit Mcleod-ganj or kullu and manali.so we should be able to give him that amount of flexibility to choose between Mcleod-ganj and manali(with kullu).So for that we should give option to him after he select shimla.that with it what he wants to see exacly and where he can stay what he can eat and in each place what he can watch.It will be better if we can provide 360' video of that places to him(optional for now).He can see map attached to it as a idea of distance,trafic and weather app of google to see weather of that place(We want to use free features of google and any company to provide every facility) 
6. we can use google map route to give him dynamic route plan.not any perticular place to place plan.
7. now after all of this..we also can give him a comparative budget idea of that kind of tour offered by travel companys.It will help him to select perticular company after comparing budget..
